# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description
- My motivation for making this app is to provide myself with a reference page for whenever I need to study.
- I built this to have a study guide for people who want to study.
- This solves the problem of having to filter through class sessions and rewatching videos when instead I have a note sheet tailored for me to understand.
- I learned how to make a web application with custom styling.
